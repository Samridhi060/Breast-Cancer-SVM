# 🧠 Breast Cancer Prediction using SVM

A machine learning project to classify breast cancer as **benign** or **malignant** using **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** with both linear and non-linear (RBF) kernels.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Perform binary classification using SVM.
- Apply both **linear** and **RBF kernel** based SVM models.
- Visualize the decision boundaries in 2D using PCA.
- Tune hyperparameters like **C** and **gamma** using **GridSearchCV**.
- Evaluate model performance using **cross-validation** and a test set.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

## 📊 Features

- Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`
- PCA for 2D visualization
- Grid Search for hyperparameter tuning
- Cross-validation for model evaluation
- Decision boundary visualization

## 📈 Model Performance

* Evaluated using:

  * Accuracy
  * Confusion Matrix
  * Classification Report
  * 5-Fold Cross-Validation Score

## 📷 Visualizations
